## Setup Guide
1. Add the following community repositories to your VRChat Creator Companion app (under `Settings -> Packages -> Add Repository`)
    - VRCFury - `https://vcc.vrcfury.com`
    - Poiyomi Toon Shader - `https://poiyomi.github.io/vpm/index.json`
    - voxel's VPM registry - `https://vpm.voxint.net/index.json`
2. Go to "Manage Project", then click the plus button next to the following packages:
    - VRCFury
    - Poiyomi Toon Shader
    - Pit Vipers
3. Open the project in Unity
4. In your Project pane, go to the Prefabs folder (`Packages -> Pit Vipers -> Assets -> Prefabs`)

5. Find the existing model specific prefab under the `Prefabs` folder. Existing model specific prefabs include:
    - Novabeast
    - _If your model isn't listed, use the `Default` prefab instead_
6. Drag the desired prefab object into the root of your scene heirarchy first. Then drag it under your avatar root

7. If you're using the `Default` prefab:
    - Turn on the disabled "Pit Vipers" object (so you can see what you're doing)
    - Move/scale the game object until the glasses are in the desired spot
    - Turn the pit vipers game object back off (the child object, not the one with the VRCFury component on it)

9. (Optional) Change the color of the lens by using one of the provided materials in the "Materials" folder (or make your own, I don't care lol)
9. ???
10. PROFIT! NOW YOU LOOK SICK AS FUCK (toggle them on in your radial menu, under Clothing -> Pit Vipers)

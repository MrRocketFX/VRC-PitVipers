## How To Use
- Add VRCFury to your project ([https://vrcfury.com/download](https://vrcfury.com/download))
- Add Poiyomi toon shader to your project 
    - ([https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader/releases/download/V8.1.167/poi_Toon_7.3.50_To_8.1.167.unitypackage](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader/releases/download/V8.1.167/poi_Toon_7.3.50_To_8.1.167.unitypackage))
- Go to the Prefabs folder (Packages -> Pit Vipers -> Assets -> Pit vipers -> Prefabs)
- Drag the "Default" prefab object into your scene heirarchy. Then drag it under your avatar root
    - The "Default" prefab is suitable for most avatars and you can configure it yourself
    - If your avatar is one of the ones listed in the Prefabs folder (also below), then you should use the prefab from that folder instead
    - Model specific prefabs have been created for the following avatars:
        - Novabeast
- Turn on the disabled "Pit Vipers" object (so you can see what you're doing)
- Move/scale the game object until the glasses are in the desired spot
- (Optional) Change the color of the lens material by using one of the provided materials in the "Materials" folder (or make your own, I don't care lol)
- Turn the pit vipers game object back off (the child object, not the one with the VRCFury component on it)
- ???
- PROFIT! NOW YOU LOOK SICK AS FUCK (toggle them on in your radial menu, under Clothing -> Pit Vipers)
